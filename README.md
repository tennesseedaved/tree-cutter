tree-cutter
===========

Probably not necessarily wise to publish my first attempt at writing an ios app publically, but I think it will help me try to keep the project clean. 

The game is silly and something I imagined on my way to work where I thought about cutting down all the trees on the side of the road with a quick slash. So the game is supposed to be a car driving game where you slash trees on the side of the road as you drive around obstacles.
